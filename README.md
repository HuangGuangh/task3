# Task
Implement the simulation by following rules
## Part 1
1. Two types of figures are included in simulation: circles and rectangles.
2. All figures must have Collision Detection implemented.
3. Figures change color after collision, after 3 collisions figure has to be removed form screen 
4. All objects should collide with screen borders
5. Estimate the number of figures that your simulation can handle before it drops FPS.
